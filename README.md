# ULNER
ULNER is an open source Chinese named entity recognition data set in the field of urban life. 
It includes two parts: training set and test set, in which the number of training set samples is 6310 and the number of test set samples is 1053. 
It contains a total of 9 different entity types.


for the 9 entity types, we used different abbreviation, they are:
columnslist = ['IDX', 'CNT', 'LOC', 'GLOC', 'GPER', 'ORG', 'GORG', 'CCT', 'GDS', 'HBY', 'LCE']
LOC = loction
Gloc = generalized loction
GPER = generalized person
ORG = organization
GORG = generalized organization
CCT = contact information
GDS = goods
HBY = hobby
LCE = life service


We will release ULNER2 in the following work. ULNER2 will have a larger number of samples and may have new entity categories.
